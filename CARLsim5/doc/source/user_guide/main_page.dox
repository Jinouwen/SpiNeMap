\section main_carlsim CARLsim5
CARLsim is an efficient, easy-to-use, GPU-accelerated library for simulating large-scale spiking neural network (SNN)
models with a high degree of biological detail.
CARLsim allows execution of networks of Izhikevich spiking neurons with realistic synaptic dynamics
on both generic x86 CPUs and standard off-the-shelf GPUs.
The simulator provides a PyNN-like programming interface (C/C++), which allows 
for details and parameters to be specified at the synapse, neuron, and network level.

The present release, CARLsim5, builds on the efficiency and scalability of earlier releases (Nageswaran et al., 2009;
Richert et al., 2011).
The functionality of the simulator has been greatly expanded by the addition of a number of features
that enable and simplify the creation, tuning, and simulation of complex networks with spatial structure.

All software is available on the
<a href="http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~jkrichma/CARLsim/index.html" target="_blank"><b>CARL Website</b></a>.

New features include:
- a python interface pyCARL (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09696)
- improved saving and loading of neural networks (see \ref ch8_saving_and_loading)
- adjusted platform compatibility (Linux, Mac OS X)
- real-time and offline data analysis tools (see \ref ch7_monitoring and \ref ch9_matlab_oat)
- a more complete STDP implementation which includes neuromodulatory mechanisms (see \ref ch5_synaptic_plasticity)
- an automated parameter tuning interface that utilizes evolutionary algorithms to construct functional SNNs
  (see \ref ch10_ecj)
- a test suite for functional code verification (see \ref ch11_regression_suite)

The simulator was first introduced in 2009 (now referred to as CARLsim_v1.0), where it demonstrated near real-time
performance for 100,000 spiking neurons on a single NVIDIA GTX 280 (Nageswaran et al., 2009).
CARLsim_v2.0 added basic support for synaptic conductances, spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), 
and short-term plasticity (STP) (Richert et al., 2011).
The present release, CARLsim3, greatly expands the functionality of the simulator by adding a number of features
that enable and simplify the creation, tuning, and simulation of complex networks with spatial structure.

CARLsim was originally written by Jayram Moorkanikara Nageswaran and Micah Richert. The code is now being 
maintained and extended by Hirak Kashyap, Jinwei Xing and Kexin Chen. For a full list of contributors,
