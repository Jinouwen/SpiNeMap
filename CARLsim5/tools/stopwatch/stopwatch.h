 * \brief Utility to measure script execution time (wall-clock time) in milliseconds
 *
 * This class provides a means to measure script execution time (wall-clock time) with millisecond precision.
 *
 * The stopwatch can start, stop, and lap.
 * It can be used to time different segments of a simulation; for example, to record the time it took to build
 * a network vs. the time it took to run the network. Every segment (or lap) can be annotated with a user-defined
 * string for easier analysis.
 * The method Stopwatch::lap does also return the execution time for the previous lap. Stopwatch::stop also
 * returns the accumulated record time over all laps.
 *
 * Code example:
 * \code
 * int main() {
 *    // create and start timer (controlled by optional flag startTimer=true)
 *	  Stopwatch watch;
 *
 *	  // ---------------- CONFIG STATE -------------------
 *	  CARLsim sim("HelloWorld", CPU_MODE, USER);
 *
 *	  // configure network
 *
 *	  // ---------------- SETUP STATE -------------------
 *	  // build the network
 *	  watch.lap("setupNetwork"); // tag this lap with string "setupNetwork"
 *	  sim.setupNetwork();
 *
 *	  // ---------------- RUN STATE -------------------
 *	  watch.lap("runNetwork"); // tag this lap with string "runNetwork"
 *	  sim.runNetwork(10,0);
 *
 *	  // print stopwatch summary
 *	  watch.stop();
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Stopping the stopwatch will produce nicely formatted console output indicating the starting and stopping
 * time of each lap, as well as the accumulated time.
 * \code
