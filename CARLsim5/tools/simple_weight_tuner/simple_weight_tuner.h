 * \brief Class SimpleWeightTuner
 *
 * The SimpleWeightTuner utility is a class that implements a simple search algorithm inspired by the bisection method.
 *
 * The usage scenario is to tune the weights of a specific connection (collection of synapses) so that a specific neuron
 * group fires at a predefined target firing rateâ€”without having to recompile the network.
 * A complete code example can be found in the Tutorial subfolder 12_advanced_topics/simple_weight_tuner.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * \code
 *  // assume CARLsim object exists with the following components:
 *	int gOut=sim->createGroup("out", nNeur, EXCITATORY_NEURON);
 *	sim->setNeuronParameters(gOut, 0.02f, 0.2f, -65.0f, 8.0f);
 *	int gIn=sim->createSpikeGeneratorGroup("in", nNeur, EXCITATORY_NEURON);
 *	int c0=sim->connect(gIn, gOut, "random", RangeWeight(initWt), 0.1f, RangeDelay(1,10));
 *  // etc.
 *  sim->setupNetwork();
 *
 * 	// use weight tuner to find the weights that give 27.4 Hz spiking in gOut
 *	SimpleWeightTuner SWT(sim, 0.01, 100);
 *	SWT.setConnectionToTune(c0, 0.0);
 *	SWT.setTargetFiringRate(gOut, 27.4);
 *
 *	while (!SWT.done()) {
 *		SWT.iterate();
 *	}
 * \endcode
 *
 * \see Tutorial: \ref ch12s4s1_simple_weight_tuner
 * \see Code example: <tt>tutorial/12_advanced_topics/simple_weight_tuner/main_simple_weight_tuner.cpp</tt>
