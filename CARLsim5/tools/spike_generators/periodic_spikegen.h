 * \brief a periodic SpikeGenerator (constant ISI) creating spikes at a certain rate

 * For example, a PeriodicSpikeGenerator with rate=10Hz will schedule spikes for each neuron in the group at t=100,
 * t=200, t=300, etc. If spikeAtZero is set to true, then the first spike will be scheduled at t=0.
