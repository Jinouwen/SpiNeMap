/*!
 * \brief a SpikeGeneratorFromFile schedules spikes from a spike file binary
 *
 * This class implements a SpikeGenerator that schedules spikes exactly as specified by a spike file binary. The
 * spike file must have been created with a SpikeMonitor.
 *
 * The easiest used-case is wanting to re-run a simulation with the exact same spike trains.
 * For example, if a spike file contains two AER events (in the format <neurId,spikeTime>): <2,123> and <10,12399>,
 * then SpikeGeneratorFromFile will deliver a spike to neuron ID 2 exactly at simulation time 123ms and a spike to
 * neuron ID 10 at simulation time 12399.
 * Running the simulation for longer than that will have no effect, since there are no spikes left to schedule
 * after that.
 *
 * If in this simulation a SpikeMonitor is set on the same group, then the newly generated spike file should be
 * identical to the one used as an input to SpikeGeneratorFromFile.
 *
 * It is possible to off-set the spike times by adding a constant offsetTimeMs to every scheduled spike time.
 * Thus the AER events <2,123> and <10,12399> will be converted to <2,123+offsetTimeMs> and <10,12399+offsetTimeMs>.
 * This offset can be passed to both the constructor and SpikeGeneratorFromFile::rewind, and it can assume both
 * positive or negative. Default value is zero.
 *
 * It is also possible to repeatedly parse the spike file, adding different offsetTimeMs offsets per loop.
 * This can be achieved by passing an optional argument to SpikeGeneratorFromFile::rewind.
 *
 * Upon initialization, the class parses and buffers all spikes from the spike file in a format that allows for
 * more efficient scheduling. Note that this might take up a lot of memory if you have a large and highly active
 * neuron group.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * \code
 * // configure a CARLsim network
 * CARLsim sim("LoadFromFile", CPU_MODE, USER);
 * int gIn = sim.createSpikeGeneratorGroup("input", 10, EXCITATORY_NEURON);
 * 
 * // Initialize a SpikeGeneratorFromFile object from a previously recorded
 * // spike file (make sure that group had 10 neurons, too!)
 * SpikeGeneratorFromFile SGF("results/spk_input.dat");
 *
 * // assign spike generator to group
 * sim.setSpikeGenerator(gIn, &SGF);
 *
 * // continue configuring ...
 * sim.setupNetwork();
 * 
 * // schedule the exact same spikes as in the file
 * // let's assume the first spike time occurs at t=42ms and the last at t=967ms
 * sim.runNetwork(1,0);
 *
 * // SGF can rewind to the beginning of the spike file, but now add offset of 1000ms: this can be done
 * // either by hardcoding the number or by calling CARLsim::getSimTime:
 * SGF.rewind((int)sim.getSimTime());
 *
 * // now spikes will be scheduled again, but the first spike is at t=42+1000ms, and the last at t=967+1000ms
 * sim.runNetwork(1,0);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note Make sure the new neuron group has the exact same number of neurons as the group that was used to record
 * the spike file.
 * \attention Upon initializiation, all spikes from the spike file will be buffered as vectors of ints, which might
 * take up a lot of memory if you have a large and highly active neuron group.
 * \since v3.0

	 * \brief Rewinds the spike file to beginning of file
	 *
	 * This function rewinds the spike file to the begining and applies an offset to the spike times.
	 * This means that the SpikeGenerator will continue to schedule spikes (starting over at the beginning of
	 * the spike file), but this time it will add offsetTimeMs to all spike times.
	 *
	 * Most often, this offset is the current simulation time (in ms), which can be retrieved via
	 * CARLsim::getSimTime.
	 *
	 * Specifying an offset is necessary, because SpikeGeneratorFromFile has no direct access to CARLsim, and
	 * thus cannot know how much time has already been simulated.
	 *
	 * Consider the following illustrative example:
	 * -# Assume spike file contains only two spikes <neurId,spikeTime>: <2,123> and <6,987>
	 * -# If we run CARLsim for a second, SpikeGeneratorFromFile will schedule exactly these two spikes at times
	 *   t1=123ms and t2=987ms
	 * -# If we run CARLsim for longer, no additional spikes will be scheduled.
	 * -# However, calling SpikeGeneratorFromFile::rewind with offset 1000ms (which is what CARLsim::getSimTime
	 *    will return at that point) will re-schedule all spikes, but now t1=1000+123ms and t2=100+123ms
	 *
	 * \param[in] offsetTimeMs offset (ms) that will be applied to all scheduled spike times. Can assume
	 *                         both positive and negative values.
