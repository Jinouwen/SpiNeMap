 * \brief Class SpikeMonitor
 *
 * The SpikeMonitor class allows a user record spike data from a particular neuron group. First
 * the method CARLsim::setSpikeMonitor must be called with the group ID of the desired group as an
 * argument. The setSpikeMonitor call returns a pointer to a SpikeMonitor object which can be queried for spike data.
 *
 * There are two different modes that define what information is collected exactly.
 * - AER:   AER mode will collect the exact spike times of all neurons in the group and store them in a 2D spike
 *          spike vector. The first dimension of the vector is neuron id, the second dimension is spike times. Each
 *          element spkVector[i] is thus a vector of all spike times for the i-th neuron in the group.
 *          This mode is activated by default.
 *          Because of the sheer amount of information, it is unwise to run this mode for extended periods of time.
 *          Note that recording in this mode may significantly slow down your simulation.
 * - COUNT:	SpikeCount mode will only collect spike count information, such as the number of spikes per neuron. This
 *          mode cannot retrieve exact spike times. Thus it is not possible to calculate some of the more elaborate
 *          metrics, such as spike-time correlations.
 *
 * Spike data will not be recorded until the SpikeMonitor member function startRecording() is called.
 * Before any metrics can be computed, the user must call stopRecording(). In general, a new recording period
 * (the time period between startRecording and stopRecording calls) can be started at any point in time, and can
 * last any number of milliseconds. The SpikeMonitor has a PersistentMode, which is off by default. When
 * PersistentMode is off, only the last recording period will be considered. When PersistentMode is on, all the
 * recording periods will be considered. By default, PersistentMode can be switched on/off by calling
 * setPersistentData(bool). The total time over which the metric is calculated can be retrieved by calling
 * getRecordingTotalTime().
 *
 * The above configurations do not affect the generation of the .dat spike file. That file will always contain all the
 * spikes of all the neurons in the group, for the entire simulation.
 *
 * SpikeMonitor objects should only be used after setupNetwork has been called.
 * SpikeMonitor objects will be deallocated automatically.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * \code
 * // configure a network etc. ...
 *
 * sim.setupNetwork();
 *
 * // create a SpikeMonitor pointer to grab the pointer from setSpikeMonitor.
 * SpikeMonitor* spikeMonExc;
 * // call setSpikeMonitor with carlsim object, sim, with the group ID, excGrpId, as an argument.
 * spikeMonExc=sim.setSpikeMonitor(excGrpId);
 * // begin recording spike data for group excGrpId
 * spikeMonExc->startRecording();
 * // run simulation that generates spikes for 20 seconds.
 * sim.runNetwork(20);
 * // stop recording data for group excGrpId so we can get spike statistics.
 * spikeMonExc->stopRecording();
 * // print a summary of the spike information
 * spikeMonExc->print();
 * // get the average firing rate of each of the neurons in group excGrpId
 * vector<float> excFRs = spikeMonExc->getAllFiringRates();
 * \endcode
 *
 * For additional information on how to use the SpikeMonitor object, please see Examples/spikeInfo.
