/*!
 * \brief Class ConnectionMonitor
 *
 * The ConnectionMonitor class allows a user record weights from a particular connection. First, the method
 * CARLsim::setConnectionMonitor must be called on a specific pair of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic group. This
 * method then returns a pointer to a ConnectionMonitor object, which can be queried for connection data.
 *
 * By default, a snapshot of all the weights will be taken once per second and dumped to file.
 * The easiest way to use a ConnectionMonitor is to call CARLsim::setConnectionMonitor with file string "default".
 * This will create a file with path "results/conn_{name of pre-group}_{name of post-group}.dat".
 * It is also possible to specify a custom file string instead.
 * Alternatively, the user may suppress creation of the binary file by using file string "null" instead.
 *
 * Periodic storing can be disabled by calling ConnectionMonitor::setUpdateTimeInterval with argument intervalSec=-1.
 *
 * Additionally, during a CARLsim simulation, the ConnectionMonitor object returned by CARLsim::setConnectionMonitor can
 * be queried for connection data. The user may take a snapshot of the weights at any point in time using the method
 * ConnectionMonitor::takeSnapshot.
 * Note that a snapshot taken with this method will also be stored in the binary file.
 * However, the binary file will never contain the same snapshot (captured with a certain timestamp) twice.
 *
 * If at least two snapshots have been taken, the method ConnectionMonitor::calcWeightChanges will calculate the weight
 * changes since the last snapshot.
 * To make sure you are comparing the right snapshots, compare the timestamps returend by
 * ConnectionMonitor::getTimeMsCurrentSnapshot and ConnectionMonitor::getTimeMsLastSnapshot.
 *
 * Weights can be visualized in the Matlab Offline Analysis Toolbox (OAT) using the ConnectionMonitor utility.
 * The OAT offers ways to plot 2D weight matrices, as well as receptive fields and response fields.
 *
 * Weights can also be visualized in C++ using ConnectionMonitor::print and ConnectionMonitor::printSparse.
 *
 * Example to store weights in binary every second:
 * \code
 * // configure a network, etc. ...
 * sim.setupNetwork();
 *
 * // direct storing of snapshots to default file "results/conn_{name of pre}_{name of post}.dat".
 * sim.setConnectionMonitor(grp0, grp1, "default");
 *
 * // run the network for 10 seconds
 * sim.runNetwork(10,0);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Example that stores weight at the beginning and end of a simulation:
 * \code
 * // configure a network, etc. ...
 * sim.setupNetwork();
 *
 * // direct storing of snapshots to default file "results/conn_{name of pre}_{name of post}.dat".
 * // additionally, grab the pointer to the monitor object
 * ConnectionMonitor* CM = sim.setConnectionMonitor(grp0, grp1, "default");
 *
 * // disable periodid storing of snapshots in binary ...
 * CM->setUpdateTimeIntervalSec(-1);
 *
 * // ... and instead take a snapshot yourself and put it in the binary
 * CM->takeSnapshot();
 *
 * // run the network for 10 seconds
 * sim.runNetwork(10,0);
 *
 * // take another snapshot at the end and put it in the binary
 * CM->takeSnapshot();
 * \endcode
 *
 * Example that periodically stores to binary and does some analysis on returned weight vector
 * \code
 * // configure a network, etc. ...
 * sim.setupNetwork();
 *
 * // direct storing of snapshots to default file "results/conn_{name of pre}_{name of post}.dat".
 * // additionally, grab the pointer to the monitor object
 * ConnectionMonitor* CM = sim.setConnectionMonitor(grp0, grp1, "default");
 *
 * // retrieve initial weights (this snapshot will also end up in the binary)
 * std::vector< std::vector<float> > wt = CM->takeSnapshot();
 * printf("The weight from pre-neuron ID 3 to post-neuron ID 7 is: %f\n",wt[3][7]);
 *
 * // run the network for 5 seconds and print 2D weight matrix
 * sim.runNetwork(5,0);
 * CM->print();
 *
 * // run the network for an additional 5 seconds and retrieve weight changes between last snapshot
 * // (at the beginning) and now (after 10 seconds)
 * sim.runNetwork(5,0);
 * std::vector< std::vector<float> > wtChanges = CM->calcWeightChanges();
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note A snapshot taken programmatically with ConnectionMonitor::takeSnapshot can be put in the binary file by
 * setting an optional input flag <tt>writeToFile</tt> to true.
