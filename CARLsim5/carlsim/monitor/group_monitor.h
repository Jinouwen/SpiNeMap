 * \brief Class GroupMonitor
 *
 * The GroupMonitor class allows a user record group data (only support dopamine concentration for now) from a particular
 * neuron group. First the method CARLsim::setGroupMonitor must be called with the group ID of the desired group as an
 * argument. The setGroupMonitor call returns a pointer to a GroupMonitor object which can be queried for group data.
 *
 * Group data will not be recorded until the GroupMonitor member function startRecording() is called.
 * Before any metrics can be computed, the user must call stopRecording(). In general, a new recording period
 * (the time period between startRecording and stopRecording calls) can be started at any point in time, and can
 * last any number of milliseconds. The GroupMonitor has a PersistentMode, which is off by default. When
 * PersistentMode is off, only the last recording period will be considered. When PersistentMode is on, all the
 * recording periods will be considered. By default, PersistentMode can be switched on/off by calling
 * setPersistentData(bool). The total time over which the metric is calculated can be retrieved by calling
 * getRecordingTotalTime().
 *
 * GroupMonitor objects should only be used after setupNetwork has been called.
 * GroupMonitor objects will be deallocated automatically. The caller should not delete(free) GroupMonitor objects
 *
 * Example usage:
 * \code
 * // configure a network etc. ...
 *
 * sim.setupNetwork();
 *
 * // create a GroupMonitor pointer to grab the pointer from setGroupMonitor.
 * GroupMonitor* daGroupMon;
 * // call setGroupMonitor with carlsim object, sim, with the group ID, daGrpId, as an argument.
 * daGroupMon=sim.setGroupMonitor(daGrpId);
 * // begin recording group data for DA group
 * daGroupMon->startRecording();
 * // run simulation that generates spikes for 20 seconds.
 * sim.runNetwork(20);
 * // stop recording group data for DA group so we can get spike statistics.
 * daGroupMon->stopRecording();
 * // print a summary of the group data information
 * daGroupMon->print();
 * // get the average value of group data (only support dopamine concentration for now) of DA group
 * float avgDAValue = daGroupMon->getMeanValue();
 * \endcode
